# KickStarter Campaign Analysis

## Objective

Objective of this Project was to analyze KickStarter Campaign data. Over two billion dollars have been raised using the massively successful crowdfunding service, Kickstarter, but not every project has found success. Of the over 300,000 projects launched on Kickstarter, only a third have made it through the funding process with a positive outcome.

Since getting funded on Kickstarter requires meeting or exceeding the project's initial goal, many organizations spend months looking through past projects in an attempt to discover some trick to finding success. Thus in this project data of four thousand projects was analyzed to uncover hidden trends.

## Approach


### Basic Indicators
---
Using conditional formatting, a basic indicator on the "state "column was set. Based on the state of a project color was set to give a quick glance at the project's performance. 

| State | Conditional Formatting |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Successful | ![Green](Images/Green.png)|
| Live |![Blue](Images/Blue.png) |
| Failed |![Red](Images/Red.png) |
| Cancelled |![Yellow](Images/Yellow.png)|

### Basic Calculations
---
| Column | Purpose | Formula |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Percent Funded | To compare how much a project was funded based on pledged and goal amount | pledged / goal * 100
| Average Donation | To see how much how much each backer for the project paid on average.  | pledged / backers_count
